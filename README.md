## Introduction
Alf-Tech is a project aimed at implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This system combines the strengths of retrieval-based methods and generation-based models to produce highly accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Leverages a combination of retrieval and generation techniques for better performance.
- **Modular Architecture:** Easily customizable and extendable.
- **Scalability:** Can be scaled to handle large datasets and complex queries.

```

## Usage
Once the repository is cloned and dependencies are installed, you can start using the RAG system. Detailed instructions will be provided in the upcoming Jupyter Notebook.
